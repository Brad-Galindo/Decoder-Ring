# Decoder-Ring
JS implementations of 3 classic ciphers: Caesar, Substitution, and Polybius. Caesar replaces each letter with a fixed shift. Substitution replaces each letter with a different letter/symbol. Polybius replaces each letter with a 2-digit number. Each cipher has a module that exports a function for encoding/decoding. 



Encryption/Decryption Algorithms

This project contains three encryption/decryption algorithms: Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and Polybius Square Cipher.

Usage

Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher algorithm can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. To use the Caesar Cipher, follow these steps:

Open the caesar.js file in a text editor.
Modify the message variable to contain the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Modify the key variable to contain the key you want to use for encryption or decryption.
Run the caesar.js file using Node.js: node caesar.js
The encrypted or decrypted message will be printed to the console.
Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher algorithm can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. To use the Substitution Cipher, follow these steps:

Open the substitution.js file in a text editor.
Modify the message variable to contain the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Modify the key variable to contain the key you want to use for encryption or decryption.
Run the substitution.js file using Node.js: node substitution.js
The encrypted or decrypted message will be printed to the console.
Polybius Square Cipher

The Polybius Square Cipher algorithm can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. To use the Polybius Square Cipher, follow these steps:

Open the polybius.js file in a text editor.
Modify the message variable to contain the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Modify the key variable to contain the key you want to use for encryption or decryption.
Run the polybius.js file using Node.js: node polybius.js
The encrypted or decrypted message will be printed to the console.
