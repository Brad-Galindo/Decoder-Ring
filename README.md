# Decoder-Ring
JS implementations of 3 classic ciphers: Caesar, Substitution, and Polybius. Caesar replaces each letter with a fixed shift. Substitution replaces each letter with a different letter/symbol. Polybius replaces each letter with a 2-digit number. Each cipher has a module that exports a function for encoding/decoding.
